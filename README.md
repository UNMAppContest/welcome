# Welcome
The App Contest is open to current UNM and CNM studnets. The submission deadline will be 11:59 PM of Sunday, January 5, 2020. Rules, calendar and additional information posted at: https://appcontest.unm.edu

### How to submit your code
If you add appcontest@unm.edu as a member of your team to your submission project's repository, we will be able to reivew your code for the contest. You can choose to add us as Read-Only if you like. Then send an email with a link to your team's repository by email to appcontest@unm.edu, with the Subject line of <your app name> Official Submission before the deadline.

### What happens next
We will pick up to 10 finalists out of the submissions entered. The first cut will be made on technical and utility grounds (e.g., we can build/use your mobile app on our devices, the app has useful and apparent functionality, the battery doesn't immediately drop from 100% to 3% charge, etc.) outlined in the Scoring Perameters: Technical Score of the rules page https://appcontest.unm.edu/rules.html.

### Helpful information
From the web site: https://appcontest.unm.edu/resources/helpful.html

## What to include in your submission repository
1. README (see below)
2. Code
3. 3 Screen-shots of the App
4. 1 Screen recording of your app in action, this will be the basis of your Demo Day video that you will narrate for the judges. This screen recording need not be the final one, you will probably want to revise after receiving feed back during the Practice Session.

## What NOT to include in your submission repository
1. Student transcripts. If you are a finalist, you will be asked to bring one for each member to the manditory Demo Day Practice Session.
2. Release waivers. If you are a finalist, you can bring these to the manditory Demo Day Practice Session.

## README File
Please provide a ReadMe file with your repository. The technical judges will have no information about your app ahead of time, so tell us what the app is, what it does, who you are. Also include information about what language, framework and/or libraries you use. Imagine, we are a team of coders who have been asked to take on support an maintenance for your app. Help us to quickly get oriented around how we can understand your app.
